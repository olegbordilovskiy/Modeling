# Modeling
A C# application using WPF, designed to download and 
visualize three-dimensional models from files (.obj). 
Provides user interaction with the model by means of axis rotation 
and scaling. It is worth noting that all the logic related to the 
rendering of the model (transformation matrices, rasterization algorithms, etc.) are implemented manually, without using libraries.
